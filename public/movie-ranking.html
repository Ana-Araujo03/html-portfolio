 <h3>The Woman in the Window</h3>
 <p>Great movie about a woman who sees all these things, even potencially something involving a murder, whaatt, but did it really happen or is it all just in her head?</p>

 <h3>Encanto</h3>
 <p>Awesome movie that tells a story of a girl (Maribel) whose family has all these different, incredible gift, and she doesn't have one, so she feels out of place or like she doesn't belong with her family, she's trying her best, but her best is never enough. <br />
